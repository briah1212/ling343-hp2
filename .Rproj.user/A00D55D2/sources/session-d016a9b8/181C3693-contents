# Data Import and Cleaning

## Import data for board game ratings and details

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
library(tidytext)

# Import datasets
ratings <- read_csv('ratings.csv')
details <- read_csv('details.csv')

# Basic summaries
summary(ratings)
summary(details)
```

## Perform data cleaning: handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates

```{r}
# Clean column names and adjust specific variables
details <- details %>%
  clean_names()

# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(details))

# Convert relevant columns to integer
details <- details %>%
  mutate(across(c(yearpublished, minplayers, maxplayers, minage), as.integer))

# Fill missing numerical values with 0 and character values with "Unknown"
details <- details %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ replace_na(., 0))) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ replace_na(., "Unknown")))

# Merge datasets by 'num' or 'id'
merged_data <- details %>%
  left_join(ratings %>% clean_names(), by = "num")

# Preview the cleaned details dataset
head(merged_data)
```

# Data Exploration

## Exploring a Specific Game Category

Let’s analyze how games in the **Strategy** category differ from those in other categories in terms of mechanics, player count, and popularity. Additionally, we’ll examine the descriptions of Strategy games to identify patterns in word usage and their correlation with popularity.

### Popularity and Mechanics of Strategy Games

```{r}
# Filter for Strategy games
strategy_games <- merged_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(boardgamecategory, "Strategy"))

# Compare average ratings and user counts across categories
category_summary <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(boardgamecategory) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_rating = mean(average, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_users = mean(users_rated, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_rating))

# Plot
ggplot(category_summary, aes(x = reorder(boardgamecategory, avg_rating), y = avg_rating)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Average Ratings by Category", x = "Category", y = "Average Rating") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Common Words in Strategy Game Descriptions

```{r}
# Tokenize and count words in descriptions of Strategy games
strategy_words <- strategy_games %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, description) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

# Top 10 words
ggplot(strategy_words[1:10, ], aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top Words in Strategy Game Descriptions", x = "Word", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### TF-IDF Analysis of Game Descriptions

```{r}
# TF-IDF calculation
category_words <- merged_data %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, description) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  count(boardgamecategory, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, boardgamecategory, n)

# Top words by TF-IDF for Strategy games
strategy_tfidf <- category_words %>%
  filter(boardgamecategory == "Strategy") %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

# Plot
ggplot(strategy_tfidf, aes(x = reorder(word, tf_idf), y = tf_idf)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top TF-IDF Words in Strategy Game Descriptions", x = "Word", y = "TF-IDF") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Conclusion

Strategy games exhibit distinct mechanics, tend to have higher user engagement, and feature specific descriptive terms. TF-IDF analysis highlights unique thematic elements that may contribute to their appeal. Further analysis could explore the sentiment of descriptions and user reviews.
